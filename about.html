                  Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.

                <p class="hero-post-text">
                  After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made
                  the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects
                  projects and meet like-minded peers.

            <h3 class="main-article-heading">How I stay committed to learning</h3>

            <p class="blog-text main-text">
              I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours
              learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new
              techniques into existing projects.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-text main-text">
              While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and
              most things about my journey with the world.
            </p>

            <h3 class="main-article-heading">How I got started</h3>

            <p class="blog-text main-text">
              I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about
              what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect
              on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-text main-text">
              That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning
              summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
